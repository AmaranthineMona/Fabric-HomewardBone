# Homeward [Fabric]

![Header](https://i.imgur.com/KvFaMgN.png)

## Overview 
This mod adds a bonfire block and associated homeward bone item to allow players to quickly return home without the use of console commands or dying. Like dark souls, once a bonfire is lit a player must "rest" (right click) to pair with that bonfire. Using a homeward bone when paired with a bonfire will return the player to that location, assuming the bonfire is still present. You can only have one bonfire paired at a time, so teleports are **one way**!

This mod is intended to be used in survival or adventure modes, however it also works in creative. Each block and item have a recipe making for a more vanilla experience compared to similar mods that use console commands to register home locations. As of now, bonfires only can be placed and used in the overworld.

## Features:
 - Craftable bonfires for a vanilla experience in survival
 - Craftable homeward bones for easy 1-way teleports back to home
 - Bonfires can be used by anyone, great for team bases but protect it from PvP
 - Bonfires are mid-game expensive, but teleports are relatively free once crafted
 - Custom bonfire block inspired by Dark Souls bonfires
 
## Components:
- Bonfire - Right click to pair with the bonfire

## Mod Conflicts:
While relatively simple, this mod will conflict with any mod that uses a single Soul Sand or Soul Soil in a shapeless recipe.
